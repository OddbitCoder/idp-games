The air is filled with flickering\n\rsparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to\n\rthe touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other\n\rsounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted\n\rformations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky\n\rlight into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep\n\rgorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to\n\rhave been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire\n\rcrashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the\n\rgorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.

To move, try words\n\rlike forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,\n\rup, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod\n\rhidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of\n\rthe action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the\n\robject and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer\n\rthe object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in\n\rparticular, \"inventory\" implies \"take inventory\", which causes me to\n\rgive you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side\n\reffects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having\n\rtrouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people\n\rtrying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something\n\rbeyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely\n\rdifferent tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long\n\rdistances with a single word.  For example, \"building\" usually gets\n\ryou to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the\n\rforest.
