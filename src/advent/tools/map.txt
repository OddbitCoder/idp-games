Suspended from some unseen point far above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and midway between the canyon walls.

[113] You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the mist.

Suspended from some unseen point far above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.)  A small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.

[115] You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure" program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads: "Do not disturb the dwarves!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.

A large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large steel grate, next to which is a sign which reads, "Treasure Vault. Keys in Main Office."

The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.
