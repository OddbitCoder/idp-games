[ ] fix static data (problems with indices)
[ ] assert data types
[ ] remove obsolete #includes
[ ] optimize mem usage for static vars and arrays (use const, cast to write data)
[ ] all ints (now 2 bytes) should be long (4 bytes); make all data const to see which ones we need to promote to long
[ ] revise travel ptr usage in every function + tkk usage
[ ] change all '\n' to '\n\r'
